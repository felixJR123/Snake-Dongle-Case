## Build Guide
### Parts needed for this case
    - 3D Printed Files
        - There is a .3mf file with all the parts in this repo, If you prefer can be downloaded on Makerworld as well
    - #4-20 x 3/8 Plastic screws [Like this ones](https://a.co/d/0bXPZo7). This are countersunk but pan heads will work as well, there are files for both. Qty 4
    - Micro switch [Like this ones](https://a.co/d/fGcxnMr). This switches have 3 leads make sure to use the common and the normally open leads. Qty 2
    - With the exception of the switches the electronics and wiring are the same as the ones on the [Snake Dongle](https://github.com/joaopedropio/snake-dongle) repo.
