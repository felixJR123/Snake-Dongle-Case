# Snake Dongle Case
This is a build guide for the enclosure of the [Snake Dongle](https://github.com/joaopedropio/snake-dongle)

There are 2 different types of enclosures for this dongle, one that use the original 6x6x8 tactile switch specified on the snake dongle repo and one that use the switches used in computer mouse. Each of those versions have a variation for #4-20 or M3 screw with plastic threads and another variation for M2 screws and M2 heatset inserts.

## Build Guide for enclosure 
### <ins>Parts needed</ins>

### Enclosure
+ If you choose to use the same parts specified in the dongle repo. The 3D files are located in the folder [Tactile Switches](https://github.com/felixJR123/Snake-Dongle-Case/tree/main/Files/Tactile%20Switches)  
+ If you choose to use the mouse switches, the rest of the parts will be the same as the dongle repo but you will need to purchase 2 mouse switches. The 3D files are located in the folder [Mouse Switches](https://github.com/felixJR123/Snake-Dongle-Case/tree/main/Files/Mouse%20Switches)  
+ There is also a version that uses tactile switches but the screen is the waveshare 1.54in https://www.waveshare.com/1.54inch-LCD-Module.htm The 3D files are located in the folder [Waveshare Screen](https://github.com/felixJR123/Snake-Dongle-Case/tree/main/Files/Waveshare%20Screen)

### Electronics

### <ins>Printed Parts</ins>
Each file contains all part needed for each build, the versions with the mouse switches have 2 extra buttons.  
After choosing which version to build and downloading the file make sure print orientation is correct when compared to the picture below.
+ Supports are not necessary.
+ The screen holder is printed sideways and a brim is recommended for that part since the footprint touching the build plate is small.
![](Pictures/Print%20orientation.jpg)  

### <ins>Before Assembly</ins>
+ Before assembly make sure all the wiring is complete.
+ The buzzer usually comes with 90 degree header pins pre soldered and it needs to be removed or the buzzer will not fit in the enclosure, also it will be easier for the assembly to solder the wires from the mcu to the back side of the buzzer pcb.
+ Make sure there is enough slack in the wiring from the screen to the mcu.
+ For the version with mouse switches remove supports where the mounting holes are.
![](Pictures/Post%20Processing/Back%20Cover%20Support.jpg)  
+ Depending if you are using a nicenano or a clone check and cut away extra material on the screen holder piece.
![](Pictures/Post%20Processing/Screen%20Holder%20Modifications.jpg)  

### <ins>Assembly</ins>
+ Most assembly instructions are the same for both versions, tactile and mouse switches. The only difference is the way the switches are mounted and the version with mouse switches have 2 extra 3d printed parts for the buttons. 
+ On both versions of the enclosure the switches are secured using pieces of regular 1.75mm 3d printer filament inserted thru a set of holes around where the switches sit.

### After all the electronics have been soldered and tested
1. If you have one of the versions with M2 screws insert the heatset threads.
    + There are 2 in the main body and 2 at the tip of the rear cover where the screen holder goes.
    + If the hole on the buzzer pcb is not too large for an M2 screw then a heatset insert can be placed in the hole where the buzzer mounts, otherwise use an M3 screw threaded into the plastic.
2. Mount the switches to the back of the enclosure

![](Pictures/Mouse%20Switch%20version%20back%20with%20switches%20on.jpg)  

<ins>The rest of the steps are the same for all versions</ins>

3. Mount the buzzer and the mcu 
![](Pictures/Tactile%20Switch%20Assembly%20with%20Buzzer.jpg)

4. Mount the Screen holder
![](Pictures/Tactile%20Switch%20Assembly%20with%20Screen%20Holder.jpg)

5. Insert the screen in the main body with the wires going to the top of the enclosure
    1. The screen slides from the top part of the mounting holes in the back
    2. Then insert the bottom part of the pcb into the slot at the bottom of the main body
    3. Then insert the top holes of the pcb into the pegs at the top of the main body.
    + No glue or fasteners are needed to hold the screen, the back cover will hold it when inserted.
![](Pictures/Main%20Body%20with%20Screen.jpg)  

6. Slide the back cover making sure the screed cables are not pressing against the screen holder part (I like to twist the screen wires into a bundle to make this part easier)
