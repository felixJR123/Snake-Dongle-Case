# Snake Dongle Case
This is a build guide for the enclosure of the [Snake Dongle](https://github.com/joaopedropio/snake-dongle) 
There are 2 different types of enclosures for this dongle, one that use the original 6x6x8 tactile switch specified on the snake dongle repo and one that use the switches used in computer mouse. Each of those versions have a variation with for #4-20 x 3/8 screw for plastic threads and another variation for M2 x 10 or 12 mm screws 
## Build Guide for enclosure 
### Parts needed
Pick if you want to use M2 or #4-20 plastic screws and download the correct file for it.
    * Print all the parts in the file, the screen holder part needs to be printed sideways a brim for that part is not necessary but highly suggested.
    * If you choose the version with the tactile switches from the snake dongle repo there is no need to get anything extra other that the screws.
    If you choose the version with the mouse switches you need to purchase 2 switches per dongle, the rest of the electronics are the same.
